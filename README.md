Courseware for Engineering Software as a Service
================================================

The instructor guide has permanently moved to a Gitbook at [teach.saasbook.info](https://teach.saasbook.info).  Thanks to Gitbook for letting us use the service for free!

The `discussions` directory contains reasonably well curated worksheets organized by module, suitable for small section, flipped classroom, etc. 

The `practice-exams` directory contains potential practice exams, with questions representative of those we've used at Berkeley for midterm and final exams.

The `self-checks` directory contains the Self Check questions we sometimes use in lecture for Mazur-style peer instruction, in [RuQL](/saasbook/ruql) format, in case you want to put them on a mini-quiz or something.  Note that we are aggressively moving to [PrairieLearn](prairielearn.org) for all of our non-coding-based assessments (our coding-based ones already use [Codio](codio.saasbook.info)).

**Please read the [instructor guide](teach.saasbook.info)** before diving into the above materials!
