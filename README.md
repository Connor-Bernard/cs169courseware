Courseware for Engineering Software as a Service
================================================


**Please read the [instructor guide](teach.saasbook.info)** before diving into these materials!

The instructor guide has permanently moved to a Gitbook at [teach.saasbook.info](https://teach.saasbook.info).  Thanks to Gitbook for letting us use the service for free!

In this repo:

* The `discussions` directory contains reasonably well curated worksheets organized by module, suitable for small section, flipped classroom, etc. 

* The `flipped-demos` directory contains instructor guidance and
scaffolding for a variety of livecoding-style demos you can do as part
of a flipped classroom or similar setting.

* The `practice-exams` directory contains potential practice exams, with questions representative of those we've used at Berkeley for midterm and final exams.

* The `self-checks` directory contains the Self Check questions we sometimes use in lecture for Mazur-style peer instruction, in [RuQL](/saasbook/ruql) format, in case you want to put them on a mini-quiz or something.  Note that we are aggressively moving to [PrairieLearn](prairielearn.org) for all of our non-coding-based assessments (our coding-based ones already use [Codio](codio.saasbook.info)).

The separate repo branch `gh-pages` deploys the Jekyll site
[recipes.saasbook.info](recipes.saasbook.info), which collects useful
"recipes" for doing things that don't really belong in the book or the CHIPS.
