<h1>Rails</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make a Rails app from scratch: something like RottenPotatoes </li>
<li><code>rails new rottenpotatoes</code></li>
<li>3 environments</li>
<li>What need for a model?  <ul>
<li>Model file</li>
<li>DB table? Only for AR-based models; if   table, then also need
migration (<strong>code generation</strong>)</li>
<li>Apply the migration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ActiveRecord</li>
<li><strong>Code generation:</strong> Scaffold CRUD for a movie.  Point out that scaffolds are more useful
  for quickly playing around with something and understanding how parts
  work together; usually just as much work to replace scaffold as create
  things from scratch</li>
<li>Strong parameters - show effect on <code>params[]</code> hash.  Discuss
  separation of concerns - controller mediates interaction with user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trip through creating, updating, viewing</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of redirect after create/update - idiomatic</li>
</ul>
